# Learning Curator

Curated content from disparate sources, organized into various learning pathways; these pathways are made up of steps, which have objectives; each step has various activities (which are simply links out to a resource). A step might include two in-person courses, an eLearning course, two books, three videos, and a podcast. Users can track which activities they've consumed, and as they do so, their progress is displayed as a series of progress rings.

An emerging project from the Learning Centre for the BC Public Service Agency.

## Features
