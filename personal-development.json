In her more than twenty years of research, Susan David has found that no matter how intelligent, resilient, or creative people are, when they ignore how situations or interactions make them feel, they miss opportunities to gain insight, getting hooked by thoughts, emotions, and habits that prevent them from reaching their full potential. Emotionally agile people experience the same stresses and setbacks as anyone else, but they know how to adapt, aligning their actions with their values and making small changes that lead to a life of growth.",

Tell them that you'd like them to act as a friendly observer of your presence, and that you'd like their feedback after the event. \r\n\r\nAfter, have a conversation with your friendly observer. What did they notice? Are your efforts succeeding? What do you want to change? What aspect of your presence do you need to focus on next? Make note, and track your progress in whatever way makes sense to you. Some people might record their reflections on video or voice, some might keep a notebook--do what works for you, but be sure to come back to your reflections to plan for your next opportunity to practice.
