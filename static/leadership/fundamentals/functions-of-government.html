			<div>In June 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) released 10 principles of reconciliation and 94 calls to action that lead to a path of reconciliation. In December 2015, Prime Minister Trudeau accepted all 94 calls and committed that the federal government would, in partnership with Indigenous communities, the provinces, territories, and other vital partners, fully implement the TRC Calls to Action, starting with the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The first principle of reconciliation confirms that UNDRIP is the framework for reconciliation for all sectors of Canadian society. <b>Call to action #57: Professional Development and Training for Public Servants</b>

"We call upon federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal governments to provide education to public servants on the history of Aboriginal peoples, including the history and legacy of residential schools, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Treaties and Aboriginal rights, Indigenous law, and Aboriginal-Crown relations. This will require skills-based training in intercultural competency, conflict resolution, human rights, and anti-racism."

			<div>One function of government is to uphold the rights described in the UNDRIP. This document that describes both individual and collective rights of Indigenous peoples around the world. It offers guidance on cooperative relationships with Indigenous peoples to states, the United Nations, and other international organizations based on the principles of equality, partnership, good faith and mutual respect. It addresses the rights of Indigenous peoples on issues such as:

The declaration was adopted by resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on September 13, 2007.

			<div>The BC government is committed to ensuring gender equality is reflected in our budgets, policies and programs. To support this important work, the BC Public Service is implementing a policy and budgeting tool: Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+). The implementation of GBA+ will allow for a broader assessment of how diverse groups of British Columbians may experience policies, programs and initiatives. This means that we, as public service employees, will be able to provide more comprehensive advice to decision-makers, continue to advance evidence-based policy making, and attain better results for British Columbians by being more responsive to their diverse needs and circumstances.  The Federal government has an excellent GBA+ course/toolkit online which is linked in this step.</div>

			<h4>Legislation In Action</h4>
			<div>The BC Laws website includes provincial statutes and regulations. It is the unofficial, online version of current consolidations.  Look at the frequently viewed legislation section on the right side of the page. This includes legislation such as the Employment Standards Act, the Child, Family and Community Service Act, Motor Vehicle Act, the Residential Tenancy Act and others.  Choose a piece of legislation. Which Minister is responsible for it? (Hint: You can find out here https://www.leg.bc.ca/parliamentary-business/bills-and-legislation under Acts/Minister Responsibilities) Go to the Ministry website and see how work being done in the Ministry relates to the legislation.

			<h4>BC Government Organizational Structure </h4>
			<div>This is part of the government information on www.gov.bc.ca. It outlines the organizational structure of the BC government. 

Through different links, you will learn about: Lieutenant Governor, Office of the Premier, Cabinet, Legislative Assembly, Ministries and Orgs, Public Service and Financial Disclosure. There are many links for future exploration and shows where useful info such as the parliamentary calendar can be found. 

This is a great place to start building your foundation in the structure of the provincial government. The amount of time you spend will range considerably based on how many links you pursue.

This is an excellent reference to keep for future use.</div>

			<h4>Gender-Based Analysis Plus Online Course</h4>
			<div>The BC government is committed to ensuring gender equality is reflected in our budgets, policies and programs. To support this important work, the BC Public Service is implementing a policy and budgeting tool: Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+). The implementation of GBA+ will allow for a broader assessment of how diverse groups of British Columbians may experience policies, programs and initiatives. This means that we, as public service employees, will be able to provide more comprehensive advice to decision-makers, continue to advance evidence-based policy making, and attain better results for British Columbians by being more responsive to their diverse needs and circumstances.  The Federal government has an excellent GBA+ course/toolkit online which is linked in this step.</div>
